Project used in my master degree to demonstrate the OWLSmellPLugin (can be found at https://github.com/viniciusjns/owlsmellplugin)
is able to identify 12 design smells found in the book "Refactoring for Software Design Smells - Managing Technical Debt" and 2 code smells from Martin Fowler's book "Refactoring improving the design of existing code".
